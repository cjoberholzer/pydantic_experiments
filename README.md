# Pydantic Learning Repository

Welcome to the Pydantic Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to learning Pydantic, a data validation and settings management library for Python.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to provide hands-on experiments and tutorials for learning Pydantic effectively. Whether you're new to Pydantic or looking to deepen your understanding, you'll find practical examples and explanations here.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a structured approach to organizing tutorials:

- `/tutorial_1/`
  - `README.md`: Attribution to the original tutorial content.
  - Other relevant files or code examples.

- `/tutorial_2/`
  - `README.md`: Attribution to the original tutorial content.
  - Other relevant files or code examples.

- and so on...

Each tutorial folder (`tutorial_n`) contains a `README.md` file where you can find attribution to the original tutorial content, along with any additional files or code relevant to that tutorial.
